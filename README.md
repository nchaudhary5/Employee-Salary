# Employee-Salary 


Create a class called Employee that included three instance variables-a first name(type String), a last name (type String) and a monthly salary (double). 
Provide a constructor that initialized the three instance variables. Provide a set and a get method for each instance variable. If the monthly salary is not 
positive, do not set its value. Write a test app named EmployeeTest that demonstrates class Employee's capabilities. Create two Employee objects and display each 
object's yearly salary. Then give each Employee a 10% raise and display each Employee's yearly salary again.
